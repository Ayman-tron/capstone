# IoT-Based Predictive Maintenance Capstone Project

This repository contains the code for an IoT-based predictive maintenance application using vibration data analysis. The project aims to develop a system that analyzes vibration data from industrial machinery to predict and prevent failures, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

## Overview

The project consists of various Python scripts that process vibration data collected from IoT devices attached to industrial machinery. The scripts read the data from CSV files, perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract frequency information, and analyze the results to identify dominant frequencies that may indicate potential issues.
